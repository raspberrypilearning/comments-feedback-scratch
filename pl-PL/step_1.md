Scratch provides the ability to comment on your own and other people's projects. If you do not want to allow people to comment on your project, you should turn off commenting. To turn off commenting, go to the Project Page and set the slider above the **Comments** box to **Commenting off**:

![The slider above the 'Comments' box is in the 'Commenting off' position. A message is shown saying "Sorry, comment posting has been turned off for this project."](images/comments-off.png){:width="300px"}

If you are happy and feel safe to allow people to write comments on your project, you can leave the first comment:

--- no-print ---

To report a comment, click the **Report** button above the comment. To report a project, click the **Report** button on the Project Page:
